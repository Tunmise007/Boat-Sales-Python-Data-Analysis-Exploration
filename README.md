# Boat-Sales-Python-Data-Analysis-Exploration
Welcome to the Boat-Sales-Python-Data-Analysis & Exploration project. This project aims to support Handsworth Boats, a specialised organisation that deals with the sale of yachts and boats, in their efforts to create a weekly newsletter for boat owners. The newsletter will provide valuable insights on how to increase views of their boats and stay up to date with market trends.

### Business Questions
To achieve this goal, our team will analyse recent data from the boat sales market. We will explore potential inquiries such as:

1.	What are the distinguishing features of the most frequently viewed boat listings in the past 7 days?
2.	Do the most expensive boats receive the highest number of views?
3.	Are there shared characteristics among the most viewed boats?
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, which can be accessed at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karthikbhandary2/boat-sales

### Objectives
The dataset obtained from Kaggle contained extensive details on over 9,000 boat listings, including price, dimensions, age, manufacturer, location, engine specifications, and view count in the past week. After preparing the raw data for analysis, our methodology involved:

1.	Conducting exploratory analysis to identify the boat types, materials, dimensions, and eras that tended to have the highest number of views.
2.	Comparing boat prices across boat types to determine if more expensive boats received greater visibility.
3.	Performing segmentation analysis to uncover common traits among the most viewed boat listings.

### Key findings
The key findings that emerged from our rigorous analysis using Python tools were:

1.	Motor yachts, cabin boats, and sport boats attracted the most views, while materials like fiberglass (GRP) were most popular. This indicates certain boat types and materials tend to align with consumer preferences.
2.	More expensive boats did not necessarily receive more views. Several more affordable boat types ranked among the highest in views. Pricing alone does not fully predict visibility.
3.	The most viewed boats shared common traits like gasoline outboards, length of 6-7 meters, and construction in the 1990s-2000s. This provides a profile of boat features that attract high visibility.

By leveraging Python data analysis and exploration techniques, we aim to provide insightful findings that will be valuable to Handsworth Boats and their customers. Thank you for your interest in this project.
