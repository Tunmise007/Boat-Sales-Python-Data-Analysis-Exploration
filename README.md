# Boat-Sales-Python-Data-Analysis-Exploration
Handsworth Boats is a specialised organisation that deals with the sale of yachts and boats. The marketing team is currently in the process of creating a weekly newsletter aimed at assisting boat owners in increasing views of their boats and staying up to date with market trends. The team intends to analyse recent data to gain valuable insights. Some potential inquiries that the team could explore are as follows:

1) What are the distinguishing features of the most frequently viewed boat listings in the past 7 days?

2) Do the most expensive boats receive the highest number of views?

3) Are there shared characteristics among the most viewed boats?

Dataset was from Kaggle
